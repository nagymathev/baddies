# baddies

ToDo list, in more or less priority order:

- camera control
- player* AI (we need to discuss what it should do but running away from enemies not just standing there is a good start :)
- click to spawn zombie**
- find or make graphics: zombie, player, level
- levels


*from our point of view, the enemy
**only calling them zombie for now, depending on what visuals/setting we end up with might be an orc, german, monster, robot, whatever. Our grunts.
